# Skyflo Trademarks Policy

This document describes proper use of the Skyflo trademarks, including the word marks “Skyflo”, “Skyflo.ai”, and the Skyflo logos (the “Marks”).

The Marks are owned by Karan Jagtiani and/or the Skyflo project’s legal owner.  
While the Skyflo software is open source under the Apache License 2.0, the Marks are not licensed under the Apache License. Use of the Marks is subject to this policy and applicable law.

This policy exists to ensure users can clearly distinguish official Skyflo projects from third-party or derivative works, while still enabling broad community adoption.

## Goals

- Encourage adoption of the Skyflo open-source project
- Protect users from confusion or misleading representations
- Enable accurate references without implying endorsement

## Permitted Uses (No Permission Required)

You may use the Marks without prior permission if the use is truthful, non-misleading, and does not imply endorsement or affiliation:

1. Referential use to identify the Skyflo project, software, or community
2. Compatibility statements such as “for Skyflo” or “works with Skyflo”, when accurate and not more prominent than your own branding
3. Descriptive use in articles, tutorials, documentation, comparisons, and presentations
4. Display of unmodified official Skyflo logos solely to link to the project or identify Skyflo-compatible tooling, subject to the logo rules below

## Uses Requiring Permission

Prior written permission is required to:

1. Use the Marks in a product name, company name, app name, domain name, social media handle, or advertising keyword
2. Modify the Marks or create confusingly similar names or logos
3. Use the Marks in a way that suggests sponsorship, affiliation, certification, or endorsement
4. Create or sell merchandise bearing the Marks

Permission requests: [contact@skyflo.ai](mailto:contact@skyflo.ai)

## Prohibited Uses

- Misleading, deceptive, or defamatory use of the Marks
- Combining the Marks with other trademarks or incorporating them into a new logo
- Altering colors, proportions, typography, or visual treatment of the Marks
- Registering domains, company names, or social accounts containing the Marks or confusingly similar terms

## Logo Usage Guidelines

- Use only official logo assets provided by the Skyflo project
- Maintain clear space equal to at least the height of the “S” in the logotype
- Do not stretch, rotate, recolor, or apply visual effects
- Use backgrounds that preserve contrast and legibility

## Open Source and Trademarks

The Skyflo source code is licensed under Apache License 2.0. That license does not grant rights to the Marks.

Forks, derivative works, or modified versions:
- Must not use the Skyflo name or logos as the primary project identity
- Must not present themselves as the official Skyflo project
- May describe themselves as “a fork of Skyflo” using distinct naming and branding

## Certification and Partners

Skyflo does not currently operate certification or partner programs.  
No use of the Marks may imply certification, compliance, or partnership unless explicitly authorized.

## Enforcement

We may address uses of the Marks that are confusing, misleading, or infringing.  
We prefer amicable resolution but reserve the right to pursue legal remedies if necessary.

## Attribution

When practical, include the following attribution near the first use:

“Skyflo and the Skyflo logo are trademarks of Karan Jagtiani.”
